# Getting to our wedding party
## What to expect

## Rough location

Oddfellows hotel is a smart and quirky hotel in the middle of Bruntwood park, just south of Cheadle, due south of the M60, just off the A34 down towards Wilmslow when travelling from Manchester.

## Transport options

The hotel is in the middle of a park; you can either drive and park on site, or catch a taxi from Gatley train station. It is possible to walk from the train station, or a bus route through Cheadle by, but we don't recommend that.

## In roads

The park is public and has a couple of vehicle entrances from the north and east. The road is single track, and you will probably encounter traffic from other people using the park.

## Driving

If driving, turn off the A34 at the Sainsbury's junction, and head in the other direction to follow the School's Hill road around the north edge of the park. There's a turning by a gate house nestled in the trees just before Lady Barn House School.

## Parking

There is limited parking next to the hotel. We recommend parking in the Bruntwood Park public spaces which cost a small amount for the day.
