## Location

Oddfellows hotel is a smart and quirky hotel in the middle of Bruntwood park, just south of Cheadle, due south of the M60, just off the A34 down towards Wilmslow when travelling from Manchester.

## Transport options

The hotel is in the middle of a public park; you can drive and park on site or catch a taxi.

The nearest train stations are Gatley and Cheadle Hulme; both are about a 30 minute walk, or a 5-10 minute taxi ride.

It is possible to walk from the train stations, or from a near by bus stop route through Cheadle; however we don't recommend this unless you know the area.

## In roads

The park is public and has a couple of vehicle entrances from the north and east. The road is single track, and you will probably encounter traffic from other people using the park.

## Driving

If driving from Manchester, head for the A34 heading south, and turn off the A34 at the Sainsbury's junction next to Bruntwood Park, and follow *School's Hill road* a short distance around the north edge of the park.

There's a turning by a gate house nestled in the trees just before Lady Barn House School at takes you along a single track road into the park.

## Parking

There is limited parking next to the hotel. We recommend parking in the Bruntwood Park public spaces which cost a small amount for the day. There are two main car parks next to each other if you drive a bit further.
