# Gift Registry

Your presence at our wedding is present enough, but if you'd like to bring something, please consider gifting something towards our wedding registry list.

If giving money, please note what you intend the money for, and we'll do our best to spend it lovingly.

*Please make cheques payable either to Hannah Bunce, or John Beech.*
