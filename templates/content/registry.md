# Wedding Registry

Your presence at our wedding is present enough, but if you'd like to bring something, please consider gifting something towards our wedding registry list:

Things to help us remember our wedding day:

| Idea        | Details                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Board Games | We don't really need any more board games, but maybe surprise us!                               |
| Lego        | We're sure there's a block head, space set, or extension to our Hogwarts castle we don't own... |
| Dinosaurs   | Our ever growing army of dinosaur plushies can always do with more pack members.                |

Our honeymoon is all booked and the cost is covered; we'll be jetting off to Mauritius and staying in the lovely 4-star resort of Solana Beach in the north west of the island.
